# Hello World, Again.

I guess I tried making a blog using Jekyll a couple years ago. I got it up and running but didn't understand how to use Jekyll or markdown well enough to really use github.

Now I do. 

So I let marcleon.com expire. 

I have a new URL, gotmarc@xyz.com. Instead of using it for the website domain name, I used it as a NIP05 identifier in Nostr. I am using nostr as my homepage.

Check it out.

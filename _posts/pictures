I have basically left corporate controlled social media. It's a process. It takes time, but I have been working on this for about six months.

After watching the Social Dillema and reading You Are Not A Gadget, I radically changed my worldview.  Social Media has turned us into zombies, but instead of eating people,we stare at our phones all day.  

The information age has a new currency--Your attention. You thought I was going to say bitcoin didn't you?  Nope. It's attention. Most of the big tech companies don't charge you anything.  They monitize your attention. Meta, the company that owns Facbook and Instagram has a market cap of 463 billion dollars as of this writing and it is down about 15% in one year.

Bitcoin has a market cap of 480 billion. A peer-to-peer electronic cash system is just a little more valuable than Facebook. 

* I still want to share ptos with my friends and family.

* I still want to talk to the friends I've made online.

I just decided to do it on a new protocol called Nostr.  I also decided to host my own  photos on my own server. I use Photoprism and Pixelfed.  I am not interested with sharing every photo I have ever taken over the last 20 years with Google, Facebook or any one else who might use that information against me-To sell me things I do not need.
